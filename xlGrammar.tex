\section{Introduction}

spreadsheets as programming:
- cell calculation chains as lines of code - size, example
- avg lines of code per spreadsheet in the enron dataset

motivation: why we need a defined grammar
- parsing spreadsheet formulas, analysis, extracting metrics, finding smells, exploring the structure of spreadsheets
- refer to papers needing/referring to a simple grammar
- benefit of a simple grammar and documentation for spreadsheet users
- to explore/uncover smelly syntactical constructs that are within the grammar coverage

challenges:
- official grammar for Excel defined, but too complex/implementation specific for formula analysis
- excel is very forgiving
- grammar changes with different Excel versions, eg regular expressions support, labels in formulas now expanded to cell
references, updates in the built-in functions list

our approach:
development of grammar starting from previous work (reference to simple grammar) and analyzing the two datasets, enriching the
grammar to support everything

\section{Anatomy of Excel Spreadsheets and Formulas}

Microsoft Excel is a program which allows its users to create spreadsheets.
Spreadsheets are cell-oriented dataflow programs and Excel spreadsheets are Turing complete \cite{ExcelTuringComplete}.

A single spreadsheet \emph{file} corresponds to a single (\emph{work})\emph{book}.
A workbook can contain any number of (\emph{work})\emph{sheets}.
A sheet consists of a two-dimensional grid of \emph{cells}.
The table consists or verticals \emph{rows} and horizontal \emph{columns}.
Rows are numbered sequentially top-to-bottom starting at 1, while columns are numbered left-to-right alphabetically, i.e. base-26 using A to Z as digits, starting at `A', making column 27 `AA'.

A cell can be empty or contain a \emph{constant value}, \emph{formula} or \emph{array formula}.
A formula can contain constant values, operations such as multiplication with the \texttt{*} operator and \emph{function calls} such as \texttt{SUM(\ldots)}, and most importantly \emph{references} to other cells.
Function arguments are separated by a comma.

Formulas can also work with \emph{ranges}, which are a two-dimensional matrices of cells.
Ranges can be constructed by the range operator \texttt{:} which produces a rectangular range with the two arguments as topmost left an bottommost right corners, the union operator \texttt{,} (a comma) \footnote{This is not a mathematical union as duplicates are allowed.} or the intersection operator \texttt{\char32} (a single whitespace). 
An user can also give a name to any range of cells thus creating a \emph{named range} which can be referenced in formulas by name.

\subsection{References}
The references are arguably the most important part of spreadsheets.
The value of any cell can be used in a formula by concatenating its column and row number, producing a reference like \texttt{B5}.
If a value of a cell changes this new value will be propagated to all formulas that use it.

When copying a cell to another cell by default references will be adjusted by the offset, for example copying \texttt{=A1} from cell B1 to C2 will cause the copied formula to become \texttt{=B2}.
This can be prevented by making the reference absolute by prepending a \texttt{\$} to the column index, row index or both.
The formula \texttt{=\$A\$1} will remain the same on copy while \texttt{=\$A1} will still have its row number adjusted.

An alternate style called R1C1 as opposed to the above A1 style exists, but it is very rarely seen or used by users.
In R1C1 references you specify either the offset to a cell between square brackets or its concrete location.
In R1C1 style \texttt{R[4]C[-2]} means the cell two columns to the left and four rows down, \texttt{R2C2} refers to cell B2.
The biggest advantage of R1C1 is that it causes identical formulas to be the same even when they operate on different cells or data because of their position.
These properties might make R1C1 useful as an internal representation for your intended purpose, but this grammar does not support parsing it.

\subsection{Array Formulas and Arrays}

Excel provides some limited functionality to work with one- or two-dimensional matrices. The most common ones are the perviously mentioned ranges, which directly correspond to portions of the spreadsheet.

It is also possible to construct matrices from constant values, which excel calls \emph{Array constants}. Columns are separated by commas, and rows by semicolons. As an example \texttt{\{1,2,3;4,5,6\}} constructs an array of 2 rows high and 3 columns wide.

\emph{Array Formulas} use the same syntax as normal formulas, except the use must enter \emph{Ctrl} + \emph{Shift} + \emph{Enter} to signal to Excel that it is an Array formula. Excel surround the formula with curly braces. Array Formulas allow the user to work less restrained with arrays in a formula and allow the user to return multiple results, which will be presented in multiple cells.

\subsection{External References and DDE}

Excel supports references to external spreadsheet files, which is done by prepending the file name in between square brackets like \texttt{=[Filename]Sheetname!A1}.

Formulas can also call external programs through the Windows-specific Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).
These formula's take the form of \texttt{=Program|Topic!Arguments}.

\subsection{Internationalization}

Excel formulas differ depending on the language of the software. For example function arguments are separated by a semicolon instead of a comma in locales that use the comma as a decimal separator.

Our grammar is only for the default (English) locale. Grammars for other locales can be gotten by replacing delimiters, error values and function names by their localized versions.

It is worth noting that Excel will always save formulas in either a locale-independent binary format (Excel 2003 and earlier format) or in its English version (Excel 2007 and later format). When interacting with Excel through its API two versions of the formula can be read or written: the English version and the version in the current locale.
This makes a grammar for the English version quite useful.

\section{Design Decisions}
For previous and ongoing research the authors needed a grammar for Microsoft Excel formulas with the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Be as compatible as possible
\item Produce a parse tree suited for further manipulation and analysis with minimal post-processing required
\item Be compact enough to feasibly implement with a parser generator
\end{enumerate}

Microsoft has published an official grammar for Excel formulas \todo{cite}.
However, this grammar is over 30 pages long and thus fails requirement 3.
Furthermore because of the detail of the grammar and the large number of production rules the resulting parse tree fails requirement 2.

For this reason the authors decided to construct their own grammar based with the above requirements as design goals.

\todo{In evaluation note that we have achieved the above design goals}

\subsection{Grammar class}

The class of this grammar is LALR(1), which was motivated by the available tool support and relative few restrictions as opposed to LL(1) or recursive-dependent parsers, which supports design goals 2 and 3.
Generalized LR grammar parser generators provide more freedom, but were not chosen because of lack of suitable tools for our target environment.

\subsection{Unions}
\label{subsec:desing:unions}

As previously noted the comma serves as both a union operator and a function argument separator.
This proved challenging to correctly straightforwardly implement in a LALR(1) grammar.

A straightforward implementation would use productions similar to this:

\begin{grammar}
<Union> := Reference `,' Reference

<Arguments> := <Argument> | <Argument> `,' <Arguments>
\end{grammar}

This however will cause a reduce reduce conflict, because in a formula like \texttt{=SUM(A1,1)} the parser does not have enough information to decide to reduce to a \synt{Union} or \synt{Argument} at the \texttt{,} token.

The presented grammar only parsers unions in between brackets, e.g. \texttt{=SMALL((A1,A2),1)}.
This is a trade-off between our compatibility (lower) and the compactness of the grammar (better).
We deem this decreased compatibility to be acceptable since unions are very rare and every single one we encountered was between brackets, see section \ref{sec:evaluation}.
Furthermore formulas that we now cannot parse often result in errors after evaluation anyway, for example \texttt{=A1,A1} does parse in Excel, but produces the error \texttt{\#VALUE!}.

If your implementation can support the more straightforward definition we recommend altering the grammar on this point.

\subsection{External References}

External references in formulas, both to external files and DDE, are not stored as part of the formula in the Excel storage format, but instead are replaced by a numeric index.
A formula that is presented to the user as \texttt{=[C:\textbackslash Path\textbackslash Filename.xlxs]Sheetname!A1} is internally stored as \texttt{[1]Sheetname!A1}.

For this reason this grammar supports only numeric external references.
Adding support for full filenames can be achieved by introducing an iditional token or altering the \texttt{FILE} token, but be aware that external filenames can be presented to and entered by the user in a myriad of different formats, depending on conditions such as if the file is opened in Excel.

\section{Spreadsheet Formula Grammar}

\todo{Add appendix with excel function names}

All strings and characters are case-insensitive, unless otherwise noted.

\subsection{Lexical analysis}

Table \ref{table:tokens} contains an overview of the tokens produced by the scanner in our parser. The rules are given in a very simple regular expression language, but could be easily adapted for a scanner which does not support regular expression tokens. 

Our tokens also require the scanner to support token priorities. Removing the necessity for token priorities is possible by altering the tokens and production rules, but makes the grammar more complicated and the resulting tree harder to use. Leaving the tokens as-is but not providing priorities will still result in an usable grammar, but expect errors on edge cases.

\begin{table*}

\subsection{Syntactic analysis}

We define our production rules in Extended BNF syntax. The start symbol is $Start$. If one does not wish to accept array formula's and wishes to omit the `=' at the start of a formula $Formula$ can be used as a start symbol instead, or the $Start$ non-terminal can be adjusted.

\begin{grammar}

\end{grammar}

\subsection{Operator Precedence}

All operators in Excel are left-associative, including the exponentiation operator. In order to resolve ambiguities in our grammar a LALR parser generator needs the operator precedence to be defined, which can be found in Table \ref{table:operatorprec}.

Nearly all LALR parser generators support this feature, but if you parser generator does not support operator precedence it will need to be manually encoded into the grammar.

\begin{table}
\label{table:operatorprec}
\caption{Operator precedence in Excel Formulas}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
Operator                                                                & Precedence \\
 & higher = greater \\

\&                                                                      & 2          \\
+ - (binary)                                                            & 3          \\
* /                                                                     & 4          \\
\textasciicircum                                                        & 5          \\
\%                                                                      & 6          \\
+ - (unary)                                                             & 7          \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Ambiguity}

%Unfortunately our grammar is not fully unambiguous, the root cause being the design decision in \ref{subsec:unionoperator}. In an LALR(1) parser generator \synt{Formula} and \synt{Union} cause a reduce-reduce conflict because a formula like \texttt{=(A1)} can be interpreted as both an union of one reference and a bracketed reference.
%Instruct your parser generator to choose the \synt{Formula} production to resolve this conflict.

Unfortunately our grammar is not fully unambiguous, the root cause being the design decision in section \ref{subsec:desing:unions}.
In an LALR(1) parser generator \synt{Reference} and \synt{Union} cause a shift-reduce conflict because a formula like \texttt{=(A1)} can be interpreted as both an union of one reference and a bracketed reference.
Instruct your parser generator to shift in this case, as the bracketed reference is the more common and mundane interpretation.
Both are logically equivalent.

%Unfortunately our grammar is not fully unambiguous, because we made a trade-off between avoid ambiguity, simplicity of the grammar and usefulness of the resulting trees. The following ambiguities are present and must be manually resolved using the methods your parser generator provides:

%\synt{FunctionCall} and \synt{Reference} can conflict when a bracketed reference is present where any formula can be present. Either parse is correct as they are logically equivalent, but we recommend parsing this as \synt{FunctionCall}. Example ambiguous sentence: \texttt{=(A1)}.

%\todo{Remark that there does not seem a way to properly resolve. We accept this because union is very rare.}

%\todo{Formula brackets and union}

\subsection{Intersection operator}

The intersection binary operator in Excel formulas is a single space, while the rest of the language is mostly whitespace independent.
Care must thus be taken on this point when implementing this grammar.

If your parser supports implicit tokens or operators the intersection operator can be implemented this way.
An example of implicit operators outside of Excel formulas is in calculus where multiplication is often omitted and $5a$ is equivalent to $5 \cdot a$ thus making $\cdot$ an implied operator.


\section{Evaluation}
The grammar is implemented in the Irony parser generator framework \footnote{https://irony.codeplex.com/} and the resulting parser been made available for download \footnote{link for download}. To extract formulas and feed them to the parser we built a tool that opens spreadsheets, reads all their cells and identifies which cells have the same formula in R1C1. Groups of cells that share the same formula in the R1C1 style are commonly referred to as belonging to the same sibling class. The tool then selects the first cell from each sibling class, and uses its formula string as input to the parser. It parses only one cell from each sibling class - the only differences between the formulas in a sibling class are the values of the references, so the structure of the produced abstract syntax trees is exactly the same. The abstract syntax trees are then traversed to generate a variety of information, for example, the references of cells to other cells, the functions that are used, the operations that are performed and the fixed numbers in the formulas.

To evaluate the grammar we use it to parse a total of ??? formulas. Those were found in the two major datasets available in the spreadsheet research community: The Euses dataset \cite{euses}, comprising of ?? spreadsheets and the 16.000 spreadsheets in the Enron email corpus \cite{enron}, which became available after the Enron company declared bankruptcy. In total, the spreadsheets form the two datasets include ??? formula cells. These are grouped into ??? sibling classes, and this is the number of formulas that were used as input to the parser.

A total of ??? formulas were parsed successfully, and ?? generate errors. (is this discussion here??)

\section{Wacky Grammar}
table with how often wacky syntax occurs

The grammar resulted from many cycles of parse errors, enrichments and refinements. There are parts of the grammar that cover a particularly complex set of structures, and these are the ones that are analyzed further in this section.

\subsection{References}
 
Spreadsheet formulas allow for many different types of references, including single cell references, cell ranges, horizontal or vertical ranges, named ranges and reference-returning build-in or user-defined functions. All of these references can be internal (in the same or in different sheets) or external. Syntactically, they can be expressed in a number of ways. The simplest case of a reference to a cell range can be expressed in any of the following ways:

\begin{eqnarray*}
&SUM&(A1:A2) \\
= &SUM&(Sheet1!A1:A2) \\
= &SUM&(Sheet1!A1:(A2)) \\
= &SUM&('Sheet1'!A1:A2) \\
= &SUM&(Sheet1!A1:Sheet1!A2) \\
= &SUM&(Sheet1!A1:'Sheet1'!A2) \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The <Reference> rule covers all those types of referencing expressions. It was the rule that was the most complex to devise to cover all edge cases in the two datasets.
 
how often each case is used:
- SUM(Sheet2:Sheet3!A1)
- [1]!Hub\_Consolidation
- Functions returning references (INDEX|OFFSET|INDIRECT|???) SUM(A1:INDEX(A:A,1,1:1))
- External UDFs RIGHT([1]!SheetName(),(LEN([1]!SheetName())-20))
- Prefixed right limits =SUM(Deals!F9:'Deals'!F16)
- This thing we do not know what it is =BLP|M!'INDU Index,[PX\_close\_5d]'

\subsection{Arrays}
Array formulas
- IF(OR(MONTH(GQ2) = {3,9}), IF(ABS(SUM(GQ223) - GQ225)>0.001,1,0), 0)
Arrays used as arguments
- LARGE((F38,C38),1)

\subsection{Reserved names}
- Add-in functions C9*\_xll.HEAT(B9,C9)
- \_xlnm.* =SUMIF('150000'!A:A,\_xlnm.Print\_Titles,'150000'!C:C)


\subsection{Smelly grammar constructs}
 + how often they are used
- Implicit intersect operator =COUNT(A1:A10˽A1:A5)
- Complex ranges =SUM(I8:namedRange:M8)
- Combinations of the above SUM((Total\_Cost Jan):(Total\_Cost Apr.))

\todo{Add section about the things we parse with "Contentinfile"} (we left this rule out). Couldn't figure out what the formula's meant, even with the official grammar by my side (David).

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
Grammar for Excel version ??? : old structures we do not support:
- Regular expressions Sheet1!A2 = SUM('S*'!A1) = SUM(Sheet2:Sheet3!A1) after Excel 2010
Not tested on array formulas
QuotedContent / ContentInFile were left out, discuss
